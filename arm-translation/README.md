# Exercise arm-translation

The purpose is to illustrate the translation of basic C control structures such as for loops.

"test_uint8_t.s" contains a translation of a for loop indexed by a uint8t variable.
"test_unsigned_int.s" contains a translation of a for loop indexed by an unsigned int variable.
